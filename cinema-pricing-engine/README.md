## ROUND 2  ·  BUILD ROUND
Friday night at the multiplex
The multiplex booking counter keeps mis-pricing tickets and the queue is getting angry. Seats come in tiers — Silver, Gold, Recliner — at different prices, and by showtime some tiers sell out and shouldn’t be bookable. There are offers on: a flat festival discount and a percentage off for members (capped). Every booking then adds a small per-ticket convenience fee and GST on top, and it all has to total to the exact paisa. Customers keep demanding a clear line-by-line breakup of the bill.
Build a pricing engine the counter can trust.
(The messy real-world money rules are the point — handle each correctly, and build it for any cinema counter, not one show. Get a plain booking total right first, then layer on the offers, the fee and the tax.)
The Twist
Your solution must also import a messy seat-class price list — with duplicate names (in different cases), prices in inconsistent formats, blank values, and negative prices. Clean it into a correct price list and report what was imported, de-duplicated, and rejected.
